# Password-Strength-Checker
A simple project I made in high school using basics of Python.
Nowadays it is hard to decide a password.
We need a password which is strong, secure and which cannot be hacked. 
To make a good password, we need a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters and maybe even whitespaces.
We also need a password which is easy for us to remember at all times or else it can be frustrating to forget a password. 
We can use this python program to make sure if the password you decided is secure or not. 
All you have to do is enter the password and the python program will let you know if your password is acceptable or needs improvement.
